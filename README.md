# Description
Human herpesvirus 5 is also known as Human cytomegalovirus and is typically abbreviated as HCMV. Cheng et al. 2017 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29158406) sequenced the transcriptomes of HCMV post infection. We would like to compare HCMV transcriptomes 2- and 6-days post-infection (dpi) using Bowtie2, SPAdes, and Blast+).
